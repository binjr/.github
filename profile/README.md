_binjr_ is a time series browser; it renders time series data produced by other applications as 
dynamically editable representations and provides advanced features to navigate the data smoothly and efficiently 
(drag & drop, zoom, history, detachable tabs, advanced time-range picker).
 
It is a standalone client application, that runs independently of the applications that produce the data; there are
no server or server-side components dedicated to _binjr_ that need to be installed on the source.
